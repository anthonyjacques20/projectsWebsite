# This website demonstrates some of the skills and projects that I've started, am working on, or have finished. Feel free to look around, sign up, and add comments!

## I created this website using Python, Flask, Postgres, and SQLAlchemy. I built this website to demonstrate not only the projects that I've worked on but also to demonstrate my Python experience. I am using a REST architecture. This website also contains tests to ensure that whatever changes are made do not break other parts of the website.  The testing is done using PyTest.

### This website is hosted on Heroku.  I am using the free version of Heroku which means that if no one interacts with the website for more than 30 minutes, the website will go to sleep.  This means that the first request after going to sleep will take a little longer than normal.  Then I purchased the domain from Google Domains and am pointing to the Heroku instance.
